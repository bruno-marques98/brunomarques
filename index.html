                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a dedicated and results-driven software developer with more than 3 years of diverse experience in
                        the industry. My journey began with Is.Retail, where I contributed to the development of warehouse
                        management systems, gaining valuable insights into supply chain operations and honing my
                        programming
                        skills. Collaborating with leading clients like Jeronimo Martins fueled my passion for creating
                        impactful solutions.

                        Continuing my career journey, I embraced a dynamic role working on a financing system project
                        for
                        Volkswagen's client in China. This experience immersed me in the intricate landscape of the
                        automotive industry, where I learned about international business practices and the complexities
                        of
                        financial systems.

                        Throughout my career, I've honed my expertise in software development and project management. I
                        thrive on challenges, consistently seeking opportunities to enhance efficiency and drive success
                        for
                        clients. My dedication to continuous improvement fuels my ambition to excel in the ever-evolving
                        field of software development.</p>
